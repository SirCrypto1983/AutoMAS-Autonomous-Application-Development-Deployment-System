**AutoMAS** is a groundbreaking, fully autonomous multi-agent system designed to streamline and automate the entire full-stack application development process. With AutoMAS, both developers and non-developers alike can generate, test, deploy, and manage applications with minimal effort. The system handles every stage of the software development lifecycle—from code generation to continuous deployment and monitoring—making it easier than ever to build functional, scalable, and secure applications.

## Core Capabilities:
1. **Automated Code Generation**: 
   AutoMAS generates complete backend and frontend codebases using predefined templates. Whether you need a robust REST API with Node.js (Express) or plan to expand into frontend frameworks like React or Angular, AutoMAS can quickly create the foundation of your applications.
   
2. **Comprehensive Testing**:
   AutoMAS ensures the quality of the generated code by automatically creating unit, integration, and system tests. The built-in testing agent uses industry-standard tools like Mocha and Chai for Node.js, ensuring the code behaves as expected.
   
3. **Seamless CI/CD Integration**:
   Through its CI/CD pipeline agent, AutoMAS integrates directly with GitHub Actions, automating the build, test, and deployment processes. Developers can push changes to their repository with confidence, knowing AutoMAS will handle the continuous integration and deployment seamlessly.
   
4. **Real-Time Application Monitoring**:
   AutoMAS configures monitoring for your applications using Prometheus. This ensures that all deployed applications are continuously monitored for performance and uptime. Alerts and logs help developers stay informed about the health of their services.
   
5. **Self-Improvement with Machine Learning**:
   While still in its early stages, AutoMAS includes a machine learning agent that can eventually analyze data from logs, tests, and application performance. In future versions, this will enable AutoMAS to predict issues before they happen, apply performance optimizations, and learn from past projects to improve future developments.

## How to Use AutoMAS

1. **Generate a Backend Project**:
   Run the following command to generate a backend application:
   ```bash
   node src/agents/code_generator_agent.js <project_name>
   ```

2. **Run Unit Tests**:
   After generating your project, you can run the generated tests:
   ```bash
   node src/agents/test_agent.js <project_name>
   ```

3. **Setup CI/CD Pipeline**:
   AutoMAS can automatically set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. Run this command to generate the pipeline:
   ```bash
   node src/agents/cicd_agent.js <project_name>
   ```

4. **Monitoring**:
   To set up application monitoring with Prometheus, use:
   ```bash
   node src/agents/monitoring_agent.js <project_name>
   ```

## Roadmap
- **Frontend Framework Support**: While AutoMAS currently focuses on backend code generation, future updates will introduce support for frontend frameworks like React, Vue.js, and Angular.
- **Advanced Machine Learning**: AutoMAS will leverage machine learning to predict potential issues and optimize applications automatically.
- **Cloud-Native Deployments**: Integration with containerization platforms like Docker and orchestration tools like Kubernetes for automated cloud deployments.
