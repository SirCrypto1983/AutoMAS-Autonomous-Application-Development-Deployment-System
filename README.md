AutoMAS is a fully autonomous multi-agent system designed to generate, test, deploy, and manage full-stack applications. 
This system is built to automate the entire software development lifecycle, making it easy for teams to generate functional, scalable, and secure applications without needing manual intervention.

## Key Features
- **Code Generation**: Automatically generate full-stack applications (front-end and back-end).
- **Automated Testing**: Includes unit, integration, and system tests.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Seamless integration with GitHub Actions for builds and deployment.
- **Monitoring**: Integrated with Prometheus for monitoring applications and ensuring uptime.
- **Self-Learning**: Machine Learning agents analyze data and predict potential issues for future improvements.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code and agents.
  - `agents/`: Contains the code generation, testing, CI/CD, monitoring, and machine learning agents.
- `tests/`: Contains generated test cases for backend and front-end code.
- `config/`: Configuration files for CI/CD and monitoring.
  
## How It Works

### 1. Code Generation
The **Code Generator Agent** automatically generates a backend (Node.js with Express) and can be extended to generate front-end code as well.

### 2. Testing
The **Test Agent** generates test cases using Mocha and Chai to ensure that all generated code is functional and bug-free.

### 3. CI/CD
The **CI/CD Pipeline Agent** automatically configures a GitHub Actions workflow to build and deploy the application every time changes are pushed to the repository.

### 4. Monitoring
The **Monitoring Agent** integrates with Prometheus, providing a basic configuration to monitor the applicationâ€™s health.

### 5. Machine Learning
The **Machine Learning Agent** is a placeholder for future improvements, where data can be analyzed to predict potential system issues.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SirCrypto1983/AutoMAS-Autonomous-Application-Development-Deployment-System.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd AutoMAS-Autonomous-Application-Development-Deployment-System
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Run the agents:
   - **Generate a backend project**:
     ```bash
     node src/agents/code_generator_agent.js <project_name>
     ```

   - **Generate test cases**:
     ```bash
     node src/agents/test_agent.js <project_name>
     ```

   - **Setup CI/CD pipeline**:
     ```bash
     node src/agents/cicd_agent.js <project_name>
     ```
